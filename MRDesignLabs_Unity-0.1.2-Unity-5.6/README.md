# Mixed Reality Design Labs
This repo is where Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality Design team publishes examples and explorations. The goal is to inspire creators and help them to build Mixed Reality experiences. We share sample app projects here that demonstrate how to use various types of common controls and patterns in Mixed Reality. Find out details about common controls and sample apps on https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design


# Important: Adding submodule MRDesignLab
As soon as you clone the repo, init and update submodule with git command:
```
cd MRDesignLabs_Unity
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
This will add [HUX and related tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity_tools) under Assets/MRDesignLab/ folder

Periodic Table of the Elements is a open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Lab. With this project, you can learn how to layout an array of objects in 3D space with various surface types using Object collection. Also learn how to create interactable objects that respond to standard inputs from HoloLens. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences.

## Sample app - Lunar Module ##

https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity_LunarModule

Lunar Module is a open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs, it is a spiritual sequel to the 1979 Atari classic, *Lunar Lander*. This sample app will demonstrate how to extend Hololens' base gestures with two hand tracking and xbox controller input, reactive objects to surface mapping and plane finding, and simple menu systems. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experience.
